We emphasize that no current unsupervised classi cation system can produce maximally useful results when operated alone. It is the interaction between domain experts and the machine
searching over the model space, that generates new knowledge. Both bring unique information and abilities to the database analysis task, and each enhances the others' e ectiveness. We illustrate this point with several applications of AutoClass to complex real world databases, and describe the resulting successes and failures.},

  abstract = {We describe a Bayesian approach to the unsupervised discovery of classes in a set of cases,
sometimes called finite mixture separation or clustering. The main difference between clustering and
our approach is that we search for the "best" set of class descriptions rather than grouping the cases
themselves. We describe our classes in terms of probability distribution or density functions, and the
locally maximal posterior probability parameters. We rate our classifications with an approximate
posterior probability of the distribution function w.r.t. the data, obtained by marginalizing over
all the parameters. Approximation is necessitated by the computational complexity of the joint
probability, and our marginalization is w.r.t. a local maxima in the parameter space. This posterior
probability rating allows direct comparison of alternate density functions that differ in number of
classes and/or individual class density functions.
We discuss the rationale behind our approach to classification. We give the mathematical
development for the basic mixture model, describe the approximations needed for computational
tractability, give some specifics of models for several common attribute types, and describe some of
the results achieved by the AutoClass program ..},
